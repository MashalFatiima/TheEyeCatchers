# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based approach to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in high-resolution retinal fundus images. Using a pre-trained ResNet50 model, the system classifies retinal images as either having Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) or not (No_DR) and provides explainable predictions using Grad-CAM. The project is deployed as a user-friendly **Streamlit app**.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 96.97% test accuracy using ResNet50 pre-trained model.
- **Explainability**: Grad-CAM highlights regions in the retinal images that influenced the model's prediction, enhancing clinical interpretability.
- **User Interface**: A Streamlit app allows users to upload retinal images and view predictions along with Grad-CAM visualizations.

## Dataset
### Data Description
This dataset comprises a large collection of high-resolution retinal images captured under various imaging conditions. Each image is assessed by a medical professional and labeled as:

- **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)**: 0
- **No Diabetic Retinopathy (No_DR)**: 1

#### Class-to-Index Mapping
- `{'DR': 0, 'No_DR': 1}`

### Data Split
- **Training samples**: 2076
- **Validation samples**: 531
- **Test samples**: 231

### Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline includes the following steps:

- **Resize:** All images are resized to 224x224 pixels to match the input size of the ResNet50 model.
- **Normalization:** Pixel values are normalized using calculated mean and standard deviation values.
- **To Tensor:** Images are converted to PyTorch tensors for compatibility with the deep learning model.

## Model
### Architecture
- **Base Model:** ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet).
- **Feature Extraction Layers:** All pre-trained layers were frozen to retain learned features.
- **Modified Fully Connected Layers:**
  - Input: Features from ResNet50 (num_features = 2048).
  - Added a dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation for better learning.
  - Dropout layer with a rate of 0.3 for regularization.
  - Output: A dense layer with 2 neurons for binary classification (DR or No_DR).
- **Optimizer:** Adam with a learning rate of 0.001, applied only to the modified fully connected layers.
- **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss for multi-class classification.

## Deployment
### Streamlit App
The Streamlit app provides a simple interface for:
1. **Image Upload**: Users can upload a retinal fundus image.
2. **Prediction**: The app predicts if the image shows signs of Diabetic Retinopathy.
3. **Visualization**: Displays the Grad-CAM heatmap for explainability.

### App Interface
The following screenshots demonstrate the functionality of the Streamlit app:

1. **Home Page:** The app's landing page with an option to upload a retinal image.
   
3. **Image Upload:** Users can upload a retinal fundus image for prediction.
   
4. **Prediction and Heatmap:** Displays the prediction (DR / No_DR) along with the Grad-CAM heatmap highlighting the regions influencing the prediction.
